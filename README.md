# Yatzy

Yatzy is a java application based on the the famous dice game "Yahtzee".

## Rules

#### Object of the game

The object of Yahtzee is to obtain the highest score from throwing 5 dice.
The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and then score the roll in one of 13 categories. You must score once in each category. The score is determined by a different rule for each category.
The game ends once all 13 categories have been scored.

#### Game Start

To start with, roll all the dice. After rolling you can either score the current roll (see below), or re-roll any or all of the dice.

You may only roll the dice a total of 3 times. After rolling 3 times you must choose a category to score.

You may score the dice at any point in the round, i.e. it doesn't have to be after the 3rd roll.

#### Scoring

To score your combination of 5 dice, you click one of the 13 boxes, or write it on the scorecard (scoresheet). There are two sections to the score table - the Upper Section and the Lower Section.

Once a box has been scored, it cannot be scored again for the rest of the game, so choose wisely.

#### Upper Section Scoring

If you score in the upper section of the table, your score is the total of the specified die face.
So if you roll:
5 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 5 and score in the Fives category, your total for the category would be 15, because there are three fives, which are added together.
If the One, Three or Four Categories were selected for scoring with this roll, you would score a zero.
If placed in the Two or Six category, you would score 2 and 6 respectively.

Bonus If the total of Upper scores is 63 or more, add a bonus of 50. Note that 63 is the total of three each of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s.
